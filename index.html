	<strong><h3 style="font-family:verdana;"> Watch out for the big bugs!</h3></strong>
	<p>I was 7 years old the first time I moved to Texas. We were stationed in England and one of our neighbors had just moved there from Texas. The little girl who was my age warned me that there were <b>GIANT</b> bugs in Texas and to be careful. I was <i><b>terrified.</b></i></p>
	<br>
	<p>Luckily, it wasn't as bad as she made it seem, like this pretty guy here.</p>

	<h2>Okay, there are some big creepy crawlies though!</h2>
	<p>I think all the orbweavers of Texas are <span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">gorgeous</span> and I respect and appreciate them eating flies and mosquitos. However, I do not want them on me and I <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">hate</span> running into their webs.</p>

	<h2>You can't deny they are beautiful</h2>
	<p>I think these giant grasshoppers are so <span style="color:hotpink;font-family:Segoe, 'Segoe UI', 'DejaVu Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, 'sans-serif'">pretty and incredible</span>, some are as long as my hand!</p>
